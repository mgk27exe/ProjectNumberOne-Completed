# ProjectNumberOne-Completed
This project is my first python project. The final and finished version of the previous project I uploaded. This is my project that I developed with the python language we took at the university this semester. At first, I wanted to do the game "The admiral sank", but our teacher wanted us to incorporate what we learned into our project every week. In this way, my project, which will only be "Admiral Sunk", has turned into a small-scale application. It contains my contact information, calculator and admiral sunk game. When the application is running, you need to enter your name in order to access the contents. The entered name is saved in the database. I intend to develop this project and present it as an application. I completed the part where I got stuck in the database part with the help of my friend Berat Can Kara. See you in future projects.
